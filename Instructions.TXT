Follow the instructions given below

1. Write a code to generate a binary random variable with PMF {p, 1-p}
here p is prob of 1 with p being your input

2. Generate a large number of samples independently from the above
distribution and store the sequence

3. Repeat the above procedure, and collect the sequences. Obtain the
Histogram of the distribution of the sequences after collecting a large
number of sequences.

4. As you vary the value of p, observe any structure in the family of
sequences you have generated.

5. Choose a value of \epsilon to define your own typical set. As you
increase the value of n, observe the fraction of the sequences that lie
in the typical set.
